        <h1>Narrative Visualization Description</h1>
        

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The dataset for the narrative visualizations was downloaded from 
            <a href="https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Arrest-Data-from-2010-to-2019/yru6-6re4">
            data.lacity.org</a>. The origninal dataset contains various information of the Arrest incidents in the 
            City of Los Angeles from 2010 to 2019, 
            including 25 columns and 1.32 million rows.
            It was preprocessed by some Python script to extract the inteseted 
            information for visualisation such as the arrest type and descent.
            The entire visualization is produced using D3 javascript libraries.
        </p>

        <h3>Visualization Structure</h3>
        <p> The <b>martini glass</b> hybrid structure was used to to guide the audience through 
            several pre-defined scenes. Users follow the authors introduction and observations 
            regarding the story, and then they go to a more open area allowing more independent 
            exploration. The various scenes were presented with some useful tips and
             annotation to help users analyze the data further.
        </p>
        <h3>Scenes</h3>
        <p>
            There are six scenes in the visualization. 
            The first five scenes mostly present predefined visualization works to 
            introduce observations on some specific indices of the statistical 
            information of arrest data. However, users could select a particular category
            of arrest or year to see specific details on it dynamically.
        </p>
        <h3>Annotations</h3>
        <p>
            The visualization contains a series of annotations. For example, the extreme
             values on the curves and histograms are annotated to highlight the arrests that
             should be paid attention to.
            Some essential observations on the arrests with respect to months are annotated
            to guide users to understand the trends of some particular arrests.
            There are also instant tooltips poping up on demand for the points 
            when mouse hovers over them.
            
        </p>
        <h3>Parameters</h3>
        <p>
            Parameters allow users to interact with the visualization. There are generally three 
            three parameters. 
            <b>First</b>, the first five scenes contain two arrows to move the scenes backwards and forwards, respectively. 
            <br/>
            <b>Second</b>, the sixth scene contains parameters to change the arrest type and month dynamically
            to select interested data.
            <br/>
            <b>Lastly</b>, the instant tooltips are showing on demand at all times.
        </p>
        <h3>Triggers</h3>
        <p>
            The scene number, navigation buttons, and mouse hovering are triggers that change the narrative visualization
            according to user actions.
            Specifically, the progress bar will change dynamically as the user 
            navigates through different scenes. And the bar color will change when 
            mouse hovers over or clicks on it.
            
        </p>
       
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
            The visualization adopts a concise style, and tries to make the contents 
            informative and thoughtful. 
            For instance, there is no legends as the chart is self-explanatory 
            and details are shown on demand on the tooltip. And the height of bars uses a relative
            value that is not the actual value of arrest numbers.
            For some descents, the number of arrests is too small to show. Thus, a minimum value of 
            10 was added to the width of bar.
            It is recommended to view the web page on a computer 
            rather than a mobile device.
